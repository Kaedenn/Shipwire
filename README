Shipwire Coding Challenge Project: Inventory-to-order allocation program

==== RUNNING THE PROGRAM ====

To generate orders.txt, run Data/datagen.py from the project root directory.
See datagen.py --help for a description of how to create alternate inventories.

To run the program proper, run ./driver.py from the project root directory. The
program will scan ./orders.txt and ./inventory.txt (both paths configurable)
and generate an allocation of items for each order.

In order to digest multiple order files, one would supply the --orders argument
more than once, designating each file to process.

The program terminates when all product has been ordered and the inventory is
empty.

Example invocations of driver.py:

python ./driver.py
python ./driver.py --orders orders1.txt --orders orders2.txt
python ./driver.py --orders orders1.txt --orders orders2.txt --inventory \
    inventory.txt

==== INPUT AND OUTPUT FORMATS ====

Orders are to be in valid JSON:

{"Header": 1, "List": [{"Product": "E", "Quantity": 4}, {"Product": "A",
    "Quantity": 1}]}

where "List" contains at least one product and quantity request, and "Header"
is a unique integer per stream.
